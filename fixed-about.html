          <h5>
         
          Q: Is it safe to travel by bus during the COVID-19 pandemic?</h5>
         <p> A: AbhiBus, along with bus operators under the AbhiBus banner, have been doing a lot when it comes to upholding the safety standards that have been set by the Government of India and the MoHFW. Passengers can make their bus booking through the AbhiBus platform and travel safely with AbhiBus.</p>
        <h5>Q: What is Safety+, and what does it have to do with AbhiBus?</h5>
          <p>A: Safety+ is a new feature that customers can look for when making a bus ticket booking on the AbhiBus platform. Bus operators follow strict safety procedures such as sanitizing buses after every trip, staff with masks, temperate check of both passengers and bus staff before boarding the bus, and much more. Look for the Safety+ icon, which is denoted by a shield with a “plus” sign in the middle when you book your bus tickets online with AbhiBus.</p>
       <h5>Q: Is it safer to travel by bus or by plane during COVID-19?</h5>
        <p>A: Though a flight might save some travel time as it does go from Point A to Point B a lot faster than a bus, it is advisable to travel by bus instead. If a passenger wishes to travel via airplane, they would have to get to the terminal early and wait for a long time before boarding a flight. There is a risk of infection as the air in the plane is circulated within the sealed tube and could pose a danger if an asymptomatic passenger does carry the virus onboard. With a bus, the passenger can wait in their vehicle before boarding the bus, and therefore, crowding at a boarding point is significantly reduced. Passengers can even keep their windows open to ensure that fresh air is circulated in the bus. Measures followed on Safety+ buses considerably minimize the chance of contracting the virus on a bus than an airplane.</p>
